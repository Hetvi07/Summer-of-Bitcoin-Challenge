Task - 1

This approach uses the Knapsack algorithm using greedy method and its time complexity is **O(nÂ²)**. 

## Steps:

1 - Sorting the transactions in the order of fee/weight. 

2 - If all the parents are already present in the block then include the transaction, update fee and weight and erase it from current set else go to next higher transaction.

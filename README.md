# Summer-of-Bitcoin-Challenge

Task - 1

This approach uses the Knapsack algorithm using greedy method and its time complexity is ##O(nÂ²). 

Steps:

1 - Sorting the transactions in the order of fee/weight. 
2 - If all the parents are already present in the block then include the transaction and update fee and weight and erase it from current set else go to next higher transaction.//
